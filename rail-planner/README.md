# High Speed Rail Planner

A Google Map-based single page React app meant to measure the differences between high speed rail and other forms of transportation throughout the continental United States.

## Currently under construction

As stated, currently under construction and without a lot of the major functionality.

1.0 will include:
- Route selection between two major cities of your choice
- Several pre-defined routes to select from the map (or "Create your own" between two major cities of your choice
- Statistics screen will include: Speed (time to travel), Efficiency (carbon saved vs other forms of travel), cost (vs other forms of travel)
- Route estimator screen will include: both a time and cost comparison between HSR and other modes -- able to adjust speed/cost by train selected
- Will also be including links to HSR advocacy and political action groups
- Other small menu will be for pre-defined routes
- Article(s) on why HSR is more efficient?

## Tech stuff

Built on React, MUI. Will be adding Redux, Jest and Sass for posterity's sake. All geo information through the Google Maps APIs.
